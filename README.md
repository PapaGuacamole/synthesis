# synthesis
WIP set of tools for the Synthesis skill in [Achaea](https://www.achaea.com). Requires [Mudlet-Mapper](https://github.com/IRE-Mudlet-Mapping/ire-mapping-script) to function correctly. Makes use of [Svof](https://github.com/svof/svof/releases)'s doadd if available, otherwise uses inbuilt queueing system.

### Complete
- extract (on/off) - enable / disable auto-extracting
- esurvey - check current area for rooms which are the correct environment and have not been fully extracted in the current day
- enext - walk to nearest room listed in esurvey

### Future developments
- rift tracking
- batch synthesis of metals
- batch transmutation of minerals
- integration with other Achaea curing/queueing systems
